    <h2> Search Tools and Databases </h2>
    <br>
    Even though the Museum at the Getty Center reopens on May 25, 2021, the Getty Library remains temporarily closed to the public and most staff as we prepare to welcome readers back safely to the library and the Special Collections Reading Room.<br>
    If you are a library reader and wish to visit the Museum, you must reserve free timed-entry tickets. Your reader badge will not give you on-site access or parking validation.<br>
    Please subscribe to the Getty Library blog for information and updates about the library reopening.<br>
